# Exercise 9 - Printing, Printing, Printing

# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

# Setting variables to strings, and in the months varible we add \n to the string to cause it to make a new line for each part of the string between it and the next \n (flag?)
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "\nJan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# Printing the strings provided and then printing the contents of the variables days and months
print("Here are the days: ", days)
print("Here are some months: ", months)

# Printing entire blocks of text exactly as they are written with new lines and all, by using the three quotation marks in a row.
print("""
There's something going on here.
With the three quotes double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want. Or 5, or 6.
