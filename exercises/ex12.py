# Exercise 12 - Prompting People

#Saving the input to variables and prompting the input by providing a string...
age = input("How old are you? ")
height = input("How tall are you? ")
weight = input("How heavy are you? ")

#Printing a formatted string.
print(f"So you're {age} years old, {height} tall, and {weight} heavy.")
