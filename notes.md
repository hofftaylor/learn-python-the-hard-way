# Notes & To-Dos for LP3THW
## Things I need to follow up on:
- [ ] Make flashcards for exercise 10 drill 1
- [ ] Better understand formatted strings from ex08 & ex10 drill 3.
- [ ] Practice if/else/then statements
- [ ] Understand the concept of commands that are given to a file, and how to do them. ie; "file.command(arguments)"
- [X] ~Learn git and figure out how to get it working with Atom~
- [ ] Figure out how to get Exercise 17's one liner down to the skinniest amount of code possible.
See this(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3561279/learn-python-the-hard-way-exercise-17-extra-questions)
- [X] ~Make flashcards for exercise 18's drills~ (I made a .md file instead)

## Exercises to revisit:
- [ ] Ex 08
- [ ] Ex 10 Drill 1 & 3
- [ ] Ex 17
- [X] ~Ex 19 Drill 3~ (Made an orbital eccentricity calculator! Didn't do it 10 different ways though... BOO)
- [ ] Ex 20 Drill 2 (What is the significance of the variable(?)'f' in this one?)
- [ ] Ex 22

## Tasks to do:
- [ ] Fix ex17 code to create and copy files that use it's name, so we don't have test.txts floating around everywhere. (And clean those txt files up while we're at it.)
